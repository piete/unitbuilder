Open Legions Unit Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A running demo is available here:
http://pesartain.com/games/arcane_legions/unitbuilder

The intention is to allow an open platform to build replacement or alternative
unit cards, possibly also for non-AL fiction. They won't be tournament
legal, however, since they won't be registered with Wells Expeditions.

Not Yet Implemented / ToDo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Faction limitations on figure placement (results in NaN error for unit cost)
 * Proper figure blocking and placement
 * Allow skinning / configuration-based rulesets to build new games and modify
   existing rules
 * Save/restore created bases
 * Proper background graphics for the unit cards
 * Correct maximum icons per peg

Hosting the Unit Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This has been tested to run on Apache 2 with PHP5. Most of the code, however, 
is javascript based on jquery, so runs client side on the browser.

Where I've pilfered code from somewhere else, I've linked the reference, but 
mostly it's my own work.

Basically, I wrote this and want to keep it freely available, regardless of what
happens to the original game. Think of it as a piece of fan work, where 
immitation is the greatest form of flattery.
