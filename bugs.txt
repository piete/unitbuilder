### Outstanding
Collision detection for figure placement
Correct figure local ability placement (ie: can only be placed on the figure with that LA available)

### Fixed
Correct maximum icons per peg.
Faction limitations on figure placement (results in NaN error for unit cost).
Unit naming.
Rotate the figure bases as well as the movement grid.
Default base HP starts with 12, but it's a sortie, so it should be 8.
Extra figure slots for regrouping.
Unable to print units.
