# Open Legions Unit Builder

The intention is to allow an open platform to build replacement or alternative unit cards, possibly also for non-AL fiction. They won't be tournament legal, however, since they won't be registered with Wells Expeditions.

## Not Yet Implemented / ToDo

 * Faction limitations on figure placement (results in NaN error for unit cost)
 * Proper figure blocking and placement
 * Allow skinning / configuration-based rulesets to build new games and modify
   existing rules
 * Save/restore created bases
 * Proper background graphics for the unit cards
 * Correct maximum icons per peg

## Hosting the Unit Builder

There is a small amount of php used to dynamically generate the frontpage incuding the figure listings from a text file. The unit builder functionality is implemented with javascript (jquery), however, so runs client side. This allows you to generate a static version of the frontpage for hosting.

Where I've pilfered code from somewhere else, I've linked the reference, but 
mostly it's my own work.

Basically, I wrote this and want to keep it freely available, regardless of what
happens to the original game. Think of it as a piece of fan work, where 
immitation is the greatest form of flattery.
